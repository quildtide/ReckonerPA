# A Post Mortem for the Reckoner Rating System v\<1 (2019-2021)

## The Motivations Behind Reckoner

At some point in early 2019, I decided that I wanted to work on a rating system for a video game that I play, Planetary Annihilation.

Planetary Annihilation is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game with a relatively small player population, with an average of around 200 players online at any point (although the amount of players actively playing a multiplayer match at any point is likely far lower). This number wasn't necessarily always the case though, and the playerbase was once larger in the past.

Planetary Annihilation has a ranked system for 1v1 matches, where two players are paired against each other after entering a competitive matchmaking queue. On the other hand, many of the matches played in Planetary Annihilation are not arranged through this competitive matchmaking queue, but are instead "pick-up games" (PUGs) with the following characteristics:

- The exact rules of the game may be slightly (or massively, in some cases!) altered in ways that players can be aware ofâ€”although players might sometimes not notice relevant rule changes.
- The amount of teams per match may differ from match to match
- The amount of players per team may differ from match to match, and sometimes, teams might even be uneven in size
- Players are aware of who is on their team and who is on an opposing team before the match starts
- Players are theoretically able to leave a lobby before the match starts if they do not like the conditions of the lobby
- There are no technical barriers to players of vastly different skill levels encountering each other in a lobby
- Individual players can sometimes be playing under altered conditions compared to others in the same lobby, like with a handicap or different loss conditions.

In addition, in Planetary Annihilation, there are some other interesting environmental factors at play:

- Most of the more experienced players know each other due to the smaller playerbase size
- Players can change their names easily, which can sometimes cause an experienced player to evade detection
- Players can also create new accounts by buying a new copy of Planetary Annihilation, which makes tracking them even more difficult
- I have personally witnessed strong players changing their names in order to negotiate better terms for themselves in a lobby than what they'd receive if they were recognized.

For these reasons, I endeavoured to mod in a rating system for lobbies, but I also desired to create a custom system to deal with
